-----------------

I have humidity sensor and I want to read the humidity from it and print it to the console.

I want to do this every second. my sensor is DHT22 - https://www.anodas.lt/dht22-temperaturos-ir-dregmes-jutiklis-su-pcb

installed this package instead of Adafruit_DHT - `sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-dht`

And it works!!! Bought it today, launched it today with the help of cursor.

I'm so happy!
